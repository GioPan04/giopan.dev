					Hi! I'm Gioele Pannetto, a { age } years old programming enthusiast boy.
					I have this passion since I was 3 years old, when my father gifted me my first computer.
					When I was 7 I developed my first Visual Basic script.
					At the age of 10 I created my first website in HTML and CSS, and so on with other programming languages not only for the web.
					I also created some websites for relatives and friends, and with this I realized that in addition to the passion for IT, I also have the passion for helping others.
					I hope to help you as well!
